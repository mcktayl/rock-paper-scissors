# <Rock-Paper-Scissors-Minigame>

## Description

I wanted to build an application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while providing light entertainment for the user. This application gave me an opportunity to practice styling elements, positioning, creating and changing variables, using the math method to generate a random selection, and dom manipulation.

## Credits

I followed a tutorial from (freeCodeCamp)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org] to help complete my project.

I downloaded the icons from (The Noun Project)[https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/rock-paper-scissors/?iconspage=1]
